# Teaching 

I am passionate about teaching, and have been lucky to have taught a considerable amount throughout my career to both undergraduate and postgraduate students as well as delivering short courses to public health officials, policy makers and researchers with external partners. I have prepared, planned and delivered content to participants with a range of skills and abilities, both inside and outside of a university environment.
