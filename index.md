# About me

I'm Dr. Matthew Thomas (or just Matt), and I'm a Lecturer in Environmental Intelligence at the University of Exeter. I'm also a Visiting Researcher at the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London, where I work within the HIV inference Group. 

My research interests are in Bayesian hierarchical modelling, Bayesian computation and spatial/spatio-temporal statistics with applications in estimating exposures to environmental hazards, climate change, epidemiology and public health. Most of my research has been performed in collaboration with international experts from disciplines including epidemiologists, numerical modellers, clinicians and others from institutions such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluations (IHME).
