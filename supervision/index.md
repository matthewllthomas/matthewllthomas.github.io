# Supervision

A list of my supervisory experience is below. If you are a student and are interested in doing an MSc or PhD project in an area that aligns with my research area, then please do get in touch and we can have a discussion. 

## PhD projects

I am currently recruiting for a PhD student to work on a UKRI iCASE studentship. The project is joint with Ordnance Survey and called "Statistical Data Science Methods for Identifying Redundancy in Geo-Spatial Data". You can find more details on [FindAPhD](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/ukri-icase-ordnance-survey-studentship-statistical-data-science-methods-for-identifying-redundancy-in-geo-spatial-data/?p145978) or on the [University website](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/study/funding/award/?id=4490).
