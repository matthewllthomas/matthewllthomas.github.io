### 2017

**Poster:** GEOMED Conference 2017, Porto, Portugal
**Title:** Data Integration for high-resolution continental-scale estimation of air pollution concentrations
**Date:** 7th - 9th September 2017
%**Abstract:** Air pollution represents one of the most important environmental risk factors to human health with a number of pollutants associated with adverse health outcomes. Epidemiological studies designed to estimate the risks associated with air pollution require accurate measures of concentrations with comprehensive coverage of a study area. Traditionally, these have been based on measurements from ground monitors but this may not provide information of sufficient quality and coverage to allow accurate spatial (and temporal) prediction at any location at which estimated concentrations are required. Ground monitoring data may therefore need to be supplemented with information from other sources, such as estimates from satellite remote sensing, chemical transport models, land use and topography. Set within a Bayesian hierarchical modelling framework, downscaling models are used to align data generated at different geographical resolutions, including point locations and a series of (potentially non-aligned) grids of varying resolutions. The proposed modelling approach is used to predict concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, together with measures of uncertainty, at a high-resolution throughout Western Europe by integrating data from ground monitoring, chemical transport models together with land-use information. Performing complex Bayesian inference combining potentially large datasets may be computationally challenging and we perform approximate Bayesian inference using INLA.

**Talk:** SAMBa Summer Conference 2017
**Title:** Data Integration Model for Air Quality: A Hierarchical Approach to the Global Estimation of Exposures to Ambient Air Pollution
**Date:** 20th - 21st June 2017
%**Abstract:** Calculating the burden of disease attributed to air pollution requires accurate estimation of population level exposures to pollutants. Although coverage of ground monitoring networks is increasing, these data are insufficient to independently estimate exposures globally. Information from other sources, such as satellite retrievals, chemical transport models and land use covariates must therefore be used in combination with ground monitoring data. Each of these data sources will have their own biases and uncertainties that may vary over space. Set within a Bayesian hierarchical modelling framework, the recently developed Data Integration Model for Air Quality (DIMAQ) integrates data from multiple sources and allows spatially-varying relationships between ground measurements and other factors that estimate fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations. The outputs of the model are estimated exposures that can be combined with population estimates to produce population-level distributions of exposures for each country. DIMAQ was used to estimate exposures of PM2.5, together with associated measures of uncertainty, on a high-resolution grid (~11 km × 11 km) covering the entire globe for use in the 2016 WHO report ‘Ambient air pollution: A global assessment of exposure and burden of disease’, and in the 2015 and 2016 updates of the Global Burden of Disease. For 2015, 92% of the world’s population lived in areas that exceeded the WHO 10 µg/m3 guideline. Fifty percent of the global population resided in areas with PM2.5 concentrations above the WHO Interim Target 1 (IT-1 of 35 µgm-3); 64% lived in areas exceeding IT-2 (25 µgm-3); and 81% lived in areas exceeding IT-3 (15 µgm-3). Nearly all (86%) of the most extreme concentrations (above 75 µgm-3) were experienced by populations in China, India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.

### 2016

**Poster:** Latin American Congress of Probability and Mathematical Statistics (CLAPEM) Conference, San Jose, Costa Rica
**Title:** Data Integration Model for Air Quality: A Hierarchical Approach to the Global Estimation of Exposures to Ambient Air Pollution
**Date:** 5th - 9th December 2016
%**Abstract:** Air pollution is a major risk factor for global health, with an estimated 3 million deaths annually being attributed to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5). The primary source of information for estimating exposures to PM2.5 has been measurements from ground monitoring networks but, although coverage is increasing, there remain regions in which monitoring is limited. Ground monitoring data therefore needs to be supplemented with information from other sources, such as satellite retrievals of aerosol optical depth and chemical transport models. A hierarchical modelling approach for integrating data from multiple sources is proposed allowing spatially-varying relationships between ground measurements and other factors that estimate air quality. Set within a Bayesian framework, the resulting Data Integration Model for Air Quality (DIMAQ) is used to estimate exposures, together with associated measures of uncertainty, on a high resolution grid covering the entire world. Bayesian analysis on this scale can be computationally challenging and here approximate Bayesian inference is performed using Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations.

TitleTrends in country-level exposures to particulate matter air pollution
Date 5th- 9th December 2016
%**Abstract:** Exposure to ambient air pollution is a major risk factor for global disease. Assessment of the impacts of air pollution on population health and evaluation of trends factors requires accurate estimates of exposures experienced by populations. The recently developed Data Integration Model for Air Quality (DIMAQ) uses estimates from satellite retrievals of aerosol optical depth and chemical transport models, population density estimates, and topography, and calibrates them with ground monitoring data in order to provide estimates of exposures to PM2.5 at a high spatial resolution (10km x 10km) globally. Based on summaries of the posterior distributions for each grid cell, it is estimated that 92% of the world's population reside in areas exceeding the World Health Organization's Air Quality Guidelines. DIMAQ was also used to produce global estimates of annual average fine particle (PM2.5) for five-year intervals from 1990 to 2010 and yearly from 2011-2015. These estimates are used to examine trends in population exposures toPM2.5 for each of 184 countries.

**Talk:** RSC Conference 2016
**Title:** Global modelling of air pollution using multiple data sources
**Date:** 14th - 16th June 2016
%**Abstract:** Air pollution is an important determinant of health and poses a significant threat globally. The World Health Organisation (WHO) are at the forefront of health modelling and policy development worldwide and must ensure that this is based on accurate and convincing evidence. A coherent framework for integrating data from various sources is required that provides accurate and effective analysis and yield exposure estimates with associated uncertainty. These estimates should be consistent with raw data and provide a means for explanation when there are discrepancies. I will explore the current methodology used within WHO to estimate air pollution levels and how changes in framework can significantly improve model predictions. I will also explain how Bayesian melding can be used to match the requirements for air pollution modelling within WHO and the associated challenges that arise from using this technique.

**Talk:** SAMBa ITT4: Health
**Title:** Techniques for Imputing Data Missing Not at Random
**Date:** 6th-10th June 2016
%As part of SAMBa, students are required to attend workshops called Integrative Think Tanks (ITTs). These events bring academic, industrial, and other external partners to present problems requiring research solutions, in which students are encouraged and trained to form mathematical questions and potential solutions from Industrial problems.

**Talk:** Numerical Analysis Seminar
**Title:** The Numerical Analysts Guide to Approximate Bayesian Inference
**Date:** 8th April 2016
%**Abstract:** Recently, there has been increased focus on performing approximate Bayesian inference, often using Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations (INLA), particularly with large-scale problems. While this may be computationally more attractive alternative to methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo, there are still issues that need to be addressed. During this talk I will explain what INLA is, why it's important and some of the interesting challenges in Numerical Linear Algebra that will need addressing in the future.
