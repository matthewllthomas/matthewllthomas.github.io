HIV continues to pose major public health challenges, particularly in the developing world. Despite considerable progress in combating the epidemic, HIV-related deaths continue to dominate recent adult mortality trends in most of sub-Saharan Africa. Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) has emerged in recent years as an effective intervention to reduce the risk of HIV acquisition among men (up to 60%). As a result, programmes to scale up the coverage of circumcision have been introduced. Comprehensive estimates of MC coverage are required to evaluate the effectiveness of VMMC campaigns to date and for more focussed planning and future target setting, particularly at a subnational level. Traditionally, these have been based on survey data but this may not provide information of sufficient quality and coverage, therefore it may need to be supplemented with VMMC programme data. Combining both data sources is a complex task as total circumcision coverage combines not only medical male circumcision (MMC) but also circumcision in traditional male initiation ceremonies (TMIC). In this talk, a model is presented that combines and calibrates both survey and VMMC programme data in order to produce estimated probabilities and coverage of MMC and TMIC by space, age and time. The proposed model is implemented through a case study to estimate district-age-time specific circumcision coverage estimates using data from South Africa.
