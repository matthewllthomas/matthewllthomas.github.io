Air pollution constitutes the highest environmental risk factor in relation to heath. In order to provide the evidence required to perform health impact analyses, to inform policy and to develop potential mitigation strategies comprehensive infor- mation is required on the state of air pollution. Traditionally, information on air pollution comes from ground monitoring (GM) networks but these may not always be able to provide sufficient coverage and may need to be supplemented with infor- mation from other sources (e.g. chemical transport models). However, these other sources may only be available on grids and, as such, cannot capture micro-scale features that may be important in assessing the levels of pollution in areas of high population. Here we develop a model that allows calibration between data sources available at different levels of support, allowing the coefficients of calibration equa- tions to vary over space and time. Set within a Bayesian hierarchical framework we address the computational issues that can arise when fitting varying coefficient models in larger scale problems, especially those using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, by perform approximate Bayesian inference based on integrated nested Laplace approximations. The model is used to produce high-resolution (1km x 1km) esti- mates of NO2 and PM2.5 across Western Europe for 2010-2016. Posterior predic- tive distributions are produced for each grid-cell which offer a wealth of informa- tion, including the ability to calculate exceedance probabilities and the calculation of country-level population-weighted concentrations. Although levels of air pollu- tion are decreasing, there remain large populations that are exposed to levels that exceed the WHO Air Quality Guidelines.
